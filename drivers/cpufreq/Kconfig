config CPU_FREQ
	bool "CPU Frequency scaling"
	help
	  CPU Frequency scaling allows you to change the clock speed of 
	  CPUs on the fly. This is a nice method to save power, because 
	  the lower the CPU clock speed, the less power the CPU consumes.

	  Note that this driver doesn't automatically change the CPU
	  clock speed, you need to either enable a dynamic cpufreq governor
	  (see below) after boot, or use a userspace tool.

	  For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq>.

	  If in doubt, say N.
